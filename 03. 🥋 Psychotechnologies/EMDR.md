Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy technique developed by Francine Shapiro in 1987, primarily to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is based on the [[Adaptive Information Processing]] model, which posits that psychological stress is due to the inadequate processing of traumatic memories. EMDR aims to facilitate the processing of these memories to reduce their lingering effects​[1](http://www.emdrcouncilofscholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/What-is-EMDR-Therapy.pdf)​​[2](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20EMDR,per%20week%20for%20a)​.

EMDR is distinctive in its use of bilateral stimulation, such as guided eye movements or alternating taps, while the patient focuses on trauma memories. This dual attention stimulus is believed to lessen the intensity of the traumatic memories, reducing their vividness and the negative emotions associated with them​[1](http://www.emdrcouncilofscholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/What-is-EMDR-Therapy.pdf)​​[3](https://www.emdria.org/about-emdr-therapy/#:~:text=EMDR%20is%20a%20structured%20therapy,EMDR%29%20therapy%20is)​.

The therapy is structured into eight phases, focusing on past memories, current disturbances, and future actions. It helps clients process the memories of disturbing life experiences which continue to influence their psychological health. While it's best known for treating PTSD, the application of EMDR has expanded to other areas such as phobias and various mental health conditions resulting from adverse life experiences​[1](http://www.emdrcouncilofscholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/What-is-EMDR-Therapy.pdf)​​[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22641-emdr-therapy#:~:text=Eye%20movement%20desensitization%20and%20reprocessing,expanding%20to%20include%20treatment)​.

EMDR is considered a client-centered approach and has been effective across a wide range of diagnoses and diverse populations. It is an interactive technique that can be applied in a variety of therapeutic settings, offering a way to significantly reduce the psychological stress associated with traumatic memories​[1](http://www.emdrcouncilofscholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/What-is-EMDR-Therapy.pdf)​​[5](https://www.healthline.com/health/emdr-therapy#:~:text=What%20is%20EMDR%20therapy%3F%20Eye,the%20theory%20behind%20the)​.
