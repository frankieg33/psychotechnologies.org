Core Transformation is a personal growth method that aims to address the deepest aspirations for healing and development on emotional, physical, and spiritual levels. It is a structured process, often described as a simple 10-step method, devised to assist individuals in changing unwanted thoughts, feelings, and habits, and to help achieve goals that may have previously seemed unreachable​[1](https://www.coretransformation.org/#:~:text=Core%20Transformation%20meets%20the%20deepest,achieve%20goals%20you%20thought%20unattainable)​.

Developed within the frameworks of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), psychology, and spirituality by Connirae Andreas, Core Transformation is considered a breakthrough process for personal change. It encourages individuals to use aspects of themselves they dislike as a starting point for a transformative journey, leading to profound inner shifts that can have tangible effects on one’s life, such as career advancement and improved relationships​[2](https://www.andreasnlp.com/trainings/core-transformation/#:~:text=Core%20Transformation%20is%20an%20easy%2C,to%20yelling%20at%20the%20kids)​​[3](https://nlptrainingconcepts.com/2020/07/21/how-core-transformation-helped-me/#:~:text=What%20Core%20Transformation%20is%20about,Mending%20relationships)​.

The process is intended to be easy to follow and enjoyable, working at a deep, transformational level. It promotes effortless change, allowing people to address a wide range of behaviors from minor habits to more significant emotional responses. By focusing on inner experiences, Core Transformation aims to bring about significant and lasting changes in one’s behavior and emotional well-being​[2](https://www.andreasnlp.com/trainings/core-transformation/#:~:text=Core%20Transformation%20is%20an%20easy%2C,to%20yelling%20at%20the%20kids)​​[4](https://www.landsiedel.com/en/nlp-library/core-transformation.html#:~:text=Core%20Transformation%20is%20about%20identifying,the%20depths%20of%20your%20being)​.

The method utilizes personal experiences as gateways to deeper self-understanding and healing, initiating a journey into one’s core being, and has been touted to foster a profound sense of well-being and personal transformation​[3](https://nlptrainingconcepts.com/2020/07/21/how-core-transformation-helped-me/#:~:text=What%20Core%20Transformation%20is%20about,Mending%20relationships)​​[4](https://www.landsiedel.com/en/nlp-library/core-transformation.html#:~:text=Core%20Transformation%20is%20about%20identifying,the%20depths%20of%20your%20being)​.
