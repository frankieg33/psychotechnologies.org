The Hakomi Method is a form of experiential psychotherapy that emphasizes mindfulness and the body's role in psychological growth. Developed by Ron Kurtz in the 1970s, it incorporates elements of Western psychology and Eastern philosophy, presenting a holistic view of the person as a self-organizing system​[1](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/hakomi#:~:text=The%20Hakomi%20Method%20of%20Experiential,to%20promote%20psychological%20growth%20and)​​[2](https://zencare.co/therapy-type/hakomi#:~:text=The%20Hakomi%20method%20is%20a,on%20to%20develop%20sensorimotor%20therapy)​. This method regards individuals as organized around core memories, beliefs, and images that manifest unconsciously through habits and attitudes, influencing behavior without conscious awareness​[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakomi#:~:text=The%20Hakomi%20Method%20regards%20people,people%20unconsciously%20organize%20their%20behavior)​.

It is characterized as a body-centered approach that integrates somatic awareness—conscious perception of the body from within—with experiential techniques to facilitate self-exploration and promote healing and transformation​[1](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/hakomi#:~:text=The%20Hakomi%20Method%20of%20Experiential,to%20promote%20psychological%20growth%20and)​​[4](https://thehumancondition.com/hakomi-therapy/#:~:text=Hakomi%20therapy%2C%20also%20known%20as,1)​. The process involves cultivating a state of mindfulness, allowing for greater self-awareness and the possibility of accessing and transforming deep-seated cognitive and emotional patterns​[5](https://hakomiinstitutesouthwest.com/about-us/the-hakomi-method/#:~:text=Hakomi%20Method%20%7C%20Mindfulness,exploration%20and%20personal%20growth)​.

The therapeutic process is used not only in psychotherapy but also in educational settings to encourage personal growth and self-discovery. It is considered a mindfulness-based and somatic experience approach to change, supporting individuals in exploring and transforming their inner world through a compassionate and mindful inquiry into the body and mind's interconnectedness​[4](https://thehumancondition.com/hakomi-therapy/#:~:text=Hakomi%20therapy%2C%20also%20known%20as,1)​​[5](https://hakomiinstitutesouthwest.com/about-us/the-hakomi-method/#:~:text=Hakomi%20Method%20%7C%20Mindfulness,exploration%20and%20personal%20growth)​.
