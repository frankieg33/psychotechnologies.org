Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a psycho-somatic therapy model that conceptualizes the mind as comprising multiple parts, each with its own distinct roles, emotions, and perspectives. This view challenges the traditional monolithic understanding of the mind, providing a more nuanced approach that allows for internal conflict resolution through the recognition and interaction with these subpersonalities.

#### Principle

The IFS model is underpinned by systems psychology and draws on family therapy to understand the organization of subpersonalities, which it likens to members of a family. Each part is believed to have positive intent, even when its actions may be dysfunctional. Harmony and balance are sought not through conflict with parts but through understanding and healing them. The key components of IFS include:

- **Exiles:** Parts that carry traumatic experiences and emotional pain.
- **Managers:** Parts that protect the individual from harm and prevent traumatic experiences from entering consciousness.
- **Firefighters:** Parts that react when Exiles are activated to divert attention from pain, sometimes through destructive behaviors.

#### Process

The therapeutic process of IFS includes accessing the core Self, which is characterized by confidence, calmness, and curiosity, and from this centered state, understanding and healing the different parts. The process involves:

1. **Accessing the Self:** As a first step, the therapist helps the individual to access their core Self to lead the healing process.
2. **Identifying Parts:** The individual identifies the different parts within their internal system.
3. **Healing Parts:** Through a compassionate and understanding approach, the therapy aims to heal wounded parts and restore mental balance.

#### Most useful for

IFS is most useful for individuals experiencing internal conflict due to traumatic experiences, as it allows them to address their subpersonalities in a non-confrontational manner. It can be beneficial for those with behavioral issues, like overeating or substance abuse, as it addresses underlying parts that contribute to such behaviors.
