Gendlin Focusing is a form of insight meditation that promotes an intimate dialogue with the body’s innate wisdom. It’s not just about feeling emotions, but about connecting with the 'felt sense'—a pre-verbal, bodily understanding of a situation or personal challenge.

#### Principle

The core concept of Gendlin Focusing hinges on the belief that the body holds emotional and psychological knowledge that the mind alone cannot grasp. It stresses that intellectualizing or externalizing issues are not as effective in therapy as turning inward to the "experiential" process, where feelings are directly and bodily felt and worked through. This process involves more than just emotions; it’s about a bodily awareness that contains a mixture of sensations, emotions, and implicit understanding that doesn’t yet have words.
#### Process

Applying Gendlin Focusing involves a series of steps: clearing a space, felt sense, handle, resonating, asking, and receiving. These are not rigid but serve as a scaffolding to help individuals connect with their internal experience. It begins with clearing mental clutter to concentrate on the bodily sense of one's issues, finding words or images to symbolize this felt sense, checking for resonance between the symbol and the sense, asking what about the problem evokes this felt sense, and finally, receiving whatever insights arise​​.

1. **Clearing a Space**: Relax and ask internally, "How is my life going? What is the main thing for me right now?" allowing concerns to emerge without getting consumed by them​.
2. **Felt Sense**: Select one problem and feel its entirety without diving into its specifics​.
3. **Handle**: Find a word, phrase, or image that captures the essence of the felt sense​.
4. **Resonating**: Check if the symbol truly resonates with the felt sense, adjusting as necessary​.
5. **Asking**: Inquire what about the problem gives rise to the sensed quality, seeking a shift or release​.
6. **Receiving**: Welcome any insights or shifts, recognizing this as part of an ongoing process​.

#### Most useful for

Focusing is particularly useful for individuals in therapy who seek to break free from intellectualizing or externalizing behaviors which are less effective. Research has shown that focusing on experiential processes is predictive of successful therapy outcomes. Thus, it's beneficial for those looking to develop a deeper, more authentic connection with themselves, particularly where emotions and bodily sensations are involved. It has been suggested that teaching focusing techniques could improve therapy outcomes and might be beneficial as a preventive psychological tool.
