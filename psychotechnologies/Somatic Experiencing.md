Somatic Experiencing (SE) is a healing framework by Dr. Peter A. Levine for those grappling with trauma and other stress disorders. This body-oriented approach doesn't just address the mind but integrates bodily sensations and inherent healing responses to restore balance after traumatic events.

#### Principle

At its core, SE hinges on the belief that trauma doesn't solely stem from the event itself but from the body's thwarted response to a perceived threat, leading to lingering energy and nervous system imbalance. SE's goal is to release this trapped energy, fostering a return to a state of equilibrium and connection. The method leans on the "bottom-up" processing, which prioritizes bodily sensations over cognitive analysis to reconcile traumatic experiences.
#### Process

The SE process is a compassionate, step-by-step journey towards managing and dissipating the physiological remnants of trauma. It involves 'titration,' a careful exposure to traumatic sensations, allowing individuals to process these feelings without becoming overwhelmed. Through this, SE aids in developing a greater tolerance for discomfort, building resilience, and ultimately enabling a person to stay grounded in the present.

#### Most useful for

SE proves particularly beneficial for individuals who have experienced various forms of traumaâ€”be it from accidents, assaults, or chronic stress. It's suitable for those seeking to move past the traditional narrative-centric therapy and find healing through the wisdom of their bodies. It's about accessing the body's memory of the event rather than reliving the narrative, making it a powerful tool for those who feel stuck in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.
