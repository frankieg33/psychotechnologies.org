Hakomi is a form of psychotherapy that centers on the use of mindfulness and the body's innate wisdom to explore the psyche. Developed in the 1970s by Ron Kurtz, it integrates principles from psychology, systems theory, and Eastern philosophy to create a holistic approach to mental health.

#### Principle

At its core, Hakomi is based on five principles: mindfulness, nonviolence, organicity, unity, and body-mind holism. These principles guide the therapeutic process towards an empathic, non-intrusive exploration of the individualâ€™s inner world, emphasizing the intelligence of the organism to heal and self-organize around core memories, beliefs, and images.
#### Process

Hakomi follows a structured yet flexible process that involves establishing a healing relationship, focusing on mindfulness, evoking experience through somatic and verbal experiments, processing emotions and memories, and integrating these experiences to transform core beliefs. The method is distinctive for conducting the majority of the therapy session in mindfulness, aiming to change the person's way of being in the world.

#### Most useful for

Hakomi is most beneficial for those seeking a gentle, yet profound way to explore and transform deeply held beliefs and patterns. Its mindfulness approach can be particularly useful for individuals who have found more traditional, cognitive-focused therapies to be less effective or for those interested in integrating a bodily-focused, experiential method into their personal growth or therapeutic practice.
