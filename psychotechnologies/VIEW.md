VIEW is a transformative mindset and a cornerstone of the Connection Course by the Art of Accomplishment. It's designed to enrich self-discovery, improve productivity, and enhance enjoyment in work and relationships. VIEW represents a state of mind that can be accessed through specific exercises, allowing for a profound understanding of oneself and others, and making even conflicts a source of joy and connection.

#### Principle

The principle of VIEW is founded on four pillars: Vulnerability, Impartiality, Empathy, and Wonder. These pillars are not just techniques but represent a way of engaging with the world that enhances personal growth and connections:

- **Vulnerability** is about being honest and open, expressing your truth even when it's challenging.
- **Impartiality** means acknowledging and owning your desires without imposing them on yourself or others​.
- **Empathy** is the capacity to be present with someone's emotions without trying to change them or taking them on as your own​.
- **Wonder** involves approaching life with curiosity and an openness to the unknown without an immediate need for answers​.
#### Process

The process of integrating VIEW into one's life is experiential and practice-oriented. It's a deep-dive into self-discovery that supercharges one's capacity for impactful work, fulfilling connections, and overall enjoyment. The Connection Course provides the framework and guidance to practice this state of mind, aiming to help individuals grow, realize their full potential, and courageously face themselves.

#### Most useful for

The Connection Course, and by extension VIEW, is most useful for individuals who are on a path of self-improvement and are eager to expand their understanding of themselves and others. It's particularly beneficial for those looking to unlock their full potential in both their professional and personal lives, cultivating the capacity for meaningful work and relationships.
