Core Transformation is a process that delves into the depths of the psyche to alter deep-seated patterns of behavior and emotion. Originating from the fields of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), psychology, and spirituality, it aims to transform the way individuals experience themselves and the world, achieving profound emotional healing and well-being.

#### Principle

The core-thesis of Core Transformation is that our dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are attempts to achieve fundamental 'core states' like Peace, Oneness, and Presence. It challenges the aversive motivation schema—where suffering is seen as a prerequisite for goal attainment—and proposes that this actually leads to avoidance rather than productive action. The technique suggests that the true rewards we seek are internal states generated by our nervous system, which can be accessed directly without external achievements.
#### Process

Core Transformation invites individuals to identify behaviors and feelings they dislike and use them as a starting point for an inner journey. This process involves accessing and experiencing these core states directly, bypassing the need for external stimuli or rewards. By doing so, one can effortlessly change behaviors and feelings, from minor irritants like nail biting to more profound issues like anger or shame. This transformation is achieved through a recursive process that digs beneath each felt sense to uncover deeper intentions and align actions with true personal values.

#### Most useful for

This process is particularly beneficial for those looking to resolve deep emotional issues, change lifelong habits, or simply find a profound sense of well-being that has been elusive through other methods. It has been shown to be effective across a wide range of difficulties, from personal relationships to career advancement, and can be especially transformative for those familiar with introspective practices.
