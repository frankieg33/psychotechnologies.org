Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy treatment that's designed to alleviate the stress associated with traumatic memories. Through EMDR, individuals can process these distressing memories, reducing their long-term impact and empowering them to lead healthier, more productive lives

#### Principle

The core principle of EMDR lies in its [[Adaptive Information Processing]] model. This model suggests that many psychological issues are due to the incomplete processing of traumatic experiences. EMDR aims to process these memories adequately, enabling the brain to resolve the emotional distress and begin natural healing, akin to the body healing a physical wound. By doing so, it can transform the emotional impact of memories on a deep, personal level.
#### Process

EMDR is an eight-phase treatment that includes history-taking, preparation, assessment, desensitization, installation, body scan, closure, and reevaluation. It employs bilateral stimulation—often through guided eye movements—to help process the distressing memories. This can include recalling distressing events and reorienting one's thoughts and feelings towards a more positive belief about oneself. The process is designed to be adaptable, with the type and length of bilateral stimulation tailored to each individual.

#### Most useful for

EMDR is recognized as an effective treatment for trauma, particularly PTSD, but its use has expanded to treat various conditions like anxiety, depression, and phobias. It is especially beneficial for those who have experienced single-event traumas, as studies show significant improvement in a relatively short amount of therapy sessions. EMDR can also be helpful for people with longstanding emotional issues stemming from past experiences that are causing distress in their current life.
