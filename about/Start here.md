[[Psychotechnologies.org]] aims to gather resources about [[psychotechnologies]] to guide people on their [[self-healing]] journey.

Start by exploring the [[List of psychotechnologies]], reading other's [[Healing journeys]] or [[Use your intuition to find the right psychotechnology]].

In addition to [[psychotechnologies]], we are also gathering [[Books]], [[Related theory]], [[Projects]] and [[other resources]].

This website is a side project by [Thorge](https://twitter.com/thorgexyz); it's open source, very much work in progress, please help to improve it ([[How to contribute]])
