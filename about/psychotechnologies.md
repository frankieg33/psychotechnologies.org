A psychotechnology, as colloquially used in [TPOT](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat), is any tool that helps you to understand and heal your own psyche. 

Those include emergent and experimental like [[Internal Family Systems (IFS)]] and [[Core Transformation]]. In some sense, going for a walk or cuddling with a partner can be considered a psychotechnology and will be covered more or less as well.
