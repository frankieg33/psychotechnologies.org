**On Self-healing**
Self-healing doesn't refer to only healing by yourself. We are social animals and need other people to regulate our nervous system. And part of healing is building more secure and close relationships where you feel comfortable expressing your emotions. Rather, it refers to you taking up the full responsibility for your healing journey.
