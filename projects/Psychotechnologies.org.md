Psychotechnologies.org aims to gather resources about [[psychotechnologies]] to help people on their [[self-healing]] journey.

The goal is to help navigate the vast landscapes of psychotechnologies and find what works for them. It's what I would have waned when I first embarked on my own journey. 

To get the most out of this website, just follow your curiosity and intuition. Click around, explore, read, try things out, close the tab and come back another time. This whole project is supposed to be super *linky*. It's supposed to get you to places, to open new doors. 

This place is heavily inspired by [Meta-crisis resource page](https://metacrisis.org/META-CRISIS/00.+%F0%9F%91%8B+About/Start+Here), [TPOT](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat) and [[Other psychotechnology lists]].

This website is a side project by [Thorge](https://twitter.com/thorgexyz); it's open source, very much work in progress, please help to improve it ([[How to contribute]])
